# YAH â€“ Yet Another Hadoop
YAH is a mini-HDFS setup on your system, complete with the architectural structure consisting of Data Nodes and Name Nodes and replication of data across nodes.

With YAH, you will possess finer control over your data blocks and their replication, and allow you to create a distributed file system as per your needs. YAH also allows running Hadoop like jobs to break down computationally heavy tasks into smaller distributed tasks.
